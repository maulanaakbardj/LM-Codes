My top favorite places to travel to are Oaxaca, Mexico and Budapest, Hungary. In years gone by, I have had repeated trips to Paris and to Tunisia, also.

The train takes you to Ruggles Station at Northeastern Univ., to Back Bay station and to South Station in downtown Boston, in about 15 minutes time.

This apartment is on Ardale Street, a quiet side street off Centre Street.  This is about one-half mile from Faulkner Hospital, walking distance to the renowned Arnold Arboretum park (look for it on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)), and about 20-minute drive to the Longwood Medical Center area. I have easy, restriction-free, on-street parking here, and a back yard. Just one block from the house, there is a 7-11 convenience store, a dry-cleaner, a Mexican restaurant, a pizza parlor, a popular sports bar and grill (similar to an Irish Pub), and another restaurant for breakfast and lunch.  The house is located 1/2 mile from Roslindale Square where you will find more restaurants, 4 bakeries, the public library and the post office. There is a superb farmers market here every Saturday. The fast-train to downtown Boston stops there, too.   \n",
       "3  Roslindale is a lovely little neighborhood located right in the city of Boston.  Though a part of the actual city, once you enter it, you feel as though you have escaped to a suburb with friendly neighbors.  The area is conveniently located with access to the city’s bus and subway system.  The Orange Line and Commuter Rail services connect the area to the heart of Boston and the neighboring towns.  It is situated close to shops, restaurants, grocery stores, parks and neighboring towns.  The farmer’s market held in the neighborhood’s center, Roslindale Village, and goes on all summer on Saturday morning.  Vendors of all different types of arts, crafts, and foods come to the neighborhood.  The Arnold Arboretum is a 265 acre park constructed as part of Frederick Law Olmsted’s Emerald Necklace project to provide Boston a connection through neighborhoods through it’s parks.  Jamaica Pond is also part of the emerald necklace which sits at the confluence of Jamaica Plain (a neighboring neighb   \n",

Locals walk and bike in the Arnold Arboretum, a 265-acre oasis that is part of Frederick Law Olmsted's Emerald Necklace.....Roslindale Village is the city's original Main Street district and now one of the city's most vibrant, featuring several bistros, unique shops, and wireless Internet access.

       "2  PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: From the house, quick public transportation to Forest Hills station (Orange Line and Commuter Rail) is via two nearby MBTA bus lines. The #38 bus stops one-half block away, and takes you past the Faulkner, then to Jamaica Plain and Forest Hills.  The #51 bus stops one block away, and goes a more direct route to Forest Hills. (The bus also goes to Cleveland Circle in Brookline.) Between the two bus lines, there is a bus that stops here every 15 minutes or so on weekdays; but no service on Sunday. ALSO, the apartment is just 1/2 mile walk to the Roslindale Village MBTA commuter rail stop, Needham Line. The train takes you to Ruggles Station at Northeastern Univ., to Back Bay station and to South Station in downtown Boston, in about 15 minutes time.  There are more city busses, running 7 days a week, from this MBTA rail station. You can also pick up ZIP Cars there.

       "4  From Logan Airport  and South Station you have 3 options to get to my home: 1. Take the airport shuttle to the MBTA. (If you're at South Station, the MBTA is right at the bus station)  Take the MBTA subway to the \"Orange line\" train stop at Forest Hills station (it involves a switch that doesn't cost money).  From there, go to the Washington Street side of the station (not the Hyde Park Avenue side) and get bus #35, 36 or 37.  Get off at the Belgrade Avenue & Walworth Street stop (by 165 Belgrade Avenue).  My home is a 3-minute walk from there.   The MBTA website has a tab \"Rider Tools\" which will give you excellent, detailed routes and times to get anywhere in the city.   2. Take a cab - which usually $35 to 40 from Logan and much less from South Station, unless there is terrible traffic.  3. Or you could follow step #1 to Forest Hills Station, then take a cab from there (they are lined up) to my home (about $5-7). 4. The Silver Line is also an option - you can get their schedule on t   \n",

       "2  ABOUT ME: I'm a laid-back, friendly, unmarried guy. I work from home, spending a lot of time on the computer. I have an website that sells handmade things from Mexico. It is called \"Viva Oaxaca Folk Art.\" You will see lots of folk art in the apartment. I also run websites for other small companies. I don’t smoke, don’t have overnight guests. I keep regular hours, am friendly, considerate and quiet. I am one of the original Boston AIRBNB hosts, having signed-up with them in 2008.   I am a big traveler myself, and I love hearing stories of where guests have been or where they are heading to next.    \n",

The house is large so it allows the people within it to interact as little or as much as is preferred.  During the weekends, we are less likely to be at home especially during the day.  Some weekends, we may not even be there at all.  Upon your booking we will be able to tell you whether or not we will be there so that you will know what to expect.  We respect the privacy of our guests so we will interact as much or as little with you as you would like.  It is all based on your preference.   \n",

I will be happy to provide you any information that would be helpful in navigating Boston.  It's a wonderful city and I hope to help make your visit here enjoyable.

I have traveled frequently, in much of the world, especially central Europe, including Hungary and Slovakia. In recent years I have had many trips to Mexico, where I buy folk art for my online business, called Viva Oaxaca Folk Art. I love meeting new people, especially travelers with stories to tell.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the above, I run web sites for small companies, including a physical therapy practice, a cancer treatment center and a colonial era historic house and museum. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980s, I was a publicist and concert producer, and have presented many concerts with Judy Collins, as well as with Ella Fitzgerald, Laura Nyro, Tom Rush, Barbara Cook and Karen Akers. Now I run a channel on YouTube called \"beta.hifi.archive\" that is a collection of 50 years of video clips from the career of Judy Collins. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo come to Boston, and stay with me. Enjoy some tomatoes and cucumbers from my garden, explore my world of Mexican folk art, and let's talk about our travel adventures.\\r\\n   \n",
       "3  My husband and I live on the property.  He’s a lawyer and I work as an hospital administration.  We have an additional housemate who lives there during the week but is usually away on the weekends.  We absolutely love having guests over because it makes our big house feel full.  We love reading, watching movies, listening to music, going to concerts, traveling, eating new and different kinds of food and exploring in general.  In addition, I enjoy singing as my hobby.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe want you too feel at home while you are staying with us.  If we are at the house during your visit, we will provide you with breakfast treats and be there to assist you with any of your needs.  The house if often empty on weekends as we all enjoy spending time outside doing activities, meeting friends/family or traveling.  If we are present, we can provide a hot breakfast but if not, cereal, bread, butter, jam, eggs and milk along with pancake mix will be available.  We will provide a list of contacts you can contact if we are not at home.  Our house is incredibly comfortable and we hope you enjoy the experience of sleeping on the beautiful king sized bed with plush down bedding.  We also hope you enjoy access to the movie channels on the Smart TV which is in the living area attached to your bedroom.     \n",

My two wonderful adult sons live in their own homes in Boston.  Camping, bicycling, music, reading, and quiet time with friends and family are what I enjoy.  I love going to church and being part of the church community. Boston is a great place to live and every day I am happy to be here!\\r\\n\\r\\nMy hosting style is \"available\" but not \"hovering\"!  Some people want to be completely on their own and others like a little connection and appreciate the host being available.  I am happy to accommodate your style.   \n",

    "This is highly configurable depending on your goals.\n",
    "You can ignore columns, specify cardinality of categorical columns, configure semantic types for columns, even adjust thresholds and/or different estimator parameters, etc.\n",
    "You can find more information about OnboardingDataAssistant and other DataAssistant components (please see documentation for the complete set of DataAssistant controls) [how to choose and control the behavior of the DataAssistant tailored to your goals](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/guides/expectations/data_assistants/how_to_create_an_expectation_suite_with_the_onboarding_data_assistant).\n",

    "Performance considerations:\n",
    "- Latency: We optimized for an explicit \"question/answer\" design, which means we issue **lots** of queries. Connection latency will impact performance.\n",
    "- Data Volume: Small samples of data will often give you a great starting point for understanding the dataset. Consider configuring a sampled asset and profiling a small number of batches.\n",
